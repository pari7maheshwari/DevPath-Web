3. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Open `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase credentials.

### 🔥 Local Firebase Configuration

To run this project locally, you'll need your own Firebase project:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. **Enable Services**:
   - **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password or Google provider.
   - **Firestore**: Create a database in test mode (or apply the rules in `firestore.rules`).
   - **Storage**: Enable default bucket (or apply the rules in `storage.rules`).
3. **Register a Web App**: Add a "Web App" to your Firebase project to get your configuration object.
4. **Fill `.env.local`**: Copy the values from your Firebase config object into your `.env.local` file.
5. **Install Firebase CLI**: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
6. **Login & Use Project**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use --add <your-project-id>
   ```

> [!CAUTION]
> **Security Reminder**: Never commit your `.env.local` file. It contains sensitive keys that should remain private to your local environment.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
